# `xxd.txt`: A Raw Hex View

Source: `learning/outputs/xxd.txt` (generated by `xxd build/basic`).

What it is:

- A hex dump of the entire binary.

What to look for:

- The ELF magic at the start of the file: `7f 45 4c 46` (ASCII: `\x7fELF`).
- The embedded interpreter path (search for `ld-linux`).
- Any obvious plaintext strings.

When it is useful:

- When you want a quick "what bytes are actually there" view.
- When you're correlating offsets from `readelf -S` (file offsets) to actual bytes.

When it is annoying:

- Most learning questions are easier to answer with `readelf` and `objdump`, which understand ELF structure.
