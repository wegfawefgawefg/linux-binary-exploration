# `file.txt`: What Kind Of Binary Is This?

Source: `learning/outputs/file.txt` (generated by `file build/basic`).

Things worth understanding in the output:

- `ELF 64-bit LSB`:
  - ELF format, 64-bit, little-endian (x86-64 Linux default).
- `pie executable`:
  - This is a Position-Independent Executable (PIE). In `readelf-h.txt` it shows up as `Type: DYN`, even though it is an executable.
- `dynamically linked`:
  - It depends on shared libraries at runtime (not a static binary).
- `interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`:
  - The dynamic loader that will start the process and resolve shared libs.
- `not stripped`:
  - The binary still contains the full symbol table (`.symtab`), which makes learning easier.

If you ever see `stripped`, your `readelf -s` / `objdump -t` views will be much less helpful.
