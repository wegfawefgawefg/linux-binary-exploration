# `readelf-d.txt`: Dynamic Section (Runtime Link Info)

Source: `learning/outputs/readelf-d.txt` (generated by `readelf -d build/basic`).

This describes what the dynamic loader needs to know.

Common items:

- `NEEDED`: shared library dependencies (you should see `libc.so.6` here).
- `PLTGOT`, `JMPREL`, `RELA*`: tables used for relocations and PLT/GOT binding.
- `FLAGS_1: PIE`: confirms PIE.

If you add more library calls (for example math functions), you'll typically see more `NEEDED` entries and more relocation activity.
