# `readelf-h.txt`: ELF Header

Source: `learning/outputs/readelf-h.txt` (generated by `readelf -h build/basic`).

The ELF header is the "table of contents for the whole file".

Important fields:

- `Class`, `Data`, `Machine`: the target architecture and endianness.
- `Type`:
  - For PIE executables this often shows as `DYN`.
- `Entry point address`:
  - Where execution begins (typically `_start`, not your `main`).
- `Start of program headers`:
  - Program headers describe segments the loader maps into memory.
- `Start of section headers`:
  - Section headers are primarily for linkers and tooling (not strictly needed at runtime).

Connection to other outputs:

- The entry point relates to `_start` you can find in `readelf-s.txt` and `objdump-d.txt`.
- If you compare `program headers` (not captured here) vs `section headers` in `readelf-S.txt`, you get a better mental model of file-vs-memory layout.
