# `objdump-d.txt`: Disassembly (Actual Instructions)

Source: `learning/outputs/objdump-d.txt` (generated by `objdump -d build/basic`).

This is the "what the CPU will execute" view.

Sections you will see here:

- `.init` / `.fini`: startup/teardown glue added by the toolchain.
- `.plt`: Procedure Linkage Table stubs for calling shared-library functions.
- `.text`: your program and some compiler-generated helpers.

Things to find:

- `_start`:
  - This is the real entry point, and it calls `__libc_start_main`, which then calls your `main`.
- `main` and `add`:
  - These correspond to the C functions in `src/basic.c`.
- `printf@plt`:
  - This is the trampoline used for the external `printf` call.

Example connection to globals:

- If your C code reads a `static int POTATO`, you should see an instruction that loads from `<POTATO>` (often RIP-relative addressing on x86-64).
