# `strings.txt`: Human-Readable Bytes

Source: `learning/outputs/strings.txt` (generated by `strings build/basic`).

What it is:

- `strings` scans the binary for printable ASCII sequences.

What to look for:

- Your format string for `printf` (in this repo it is `%d`).
- Toolchain identifiers (compiler version strings, build IDs, etc).
- Library / loader references.

What it is not:

- It does not know about ELF structure. It's just a byte scan, so it can show misleading junk or miss non-ASCII data.
