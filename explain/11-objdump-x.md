# `objdump-x.txt` (Optional): One-File ELF Summary

Source: `learning/outputs/objdump-x.txt` (generated by `objdump -x build/basic`).

Status:

- Optional reference after the core lesson path.
- Use this when you want a broad sanity check, not as the primary way to learn each ELF component.

What it is:

- A broad "summary dump" that mixes several ELF views in one place:
  - file/header info
  - section and program-related metadata
  - dynamic section details
  - relocation and symbol information

When to use it:

- It is a one-stop sanity check when you want a quick combined view without jumping between many tools.
- It is good for noticing high-level changes after rebuilds (PIE flags, needed libs, relocation volume).

Things to look for in this repo:

- Dynamic dependency on `libc.so.6`.
- Signs of PIE / dynamic linking details.
- PLT/GOT and relocation-related entries that match what you see in `readelf-d.txt` and `readelf-r.txt`.

How it maps to focused lessons:

- `readelf-h.txt`, `readelf-S.txt`, `readelf-d.txt`, and `readelf-r.txt` each provide a cleaner focused view.
- `objdump-x.txt` trades precision for convenience by putting many related details together.

Quick optional exercise:

- Pick one relocation-related entry in `objdump-x.txt` and find the corresponding data in `readelf-r.txt`.
- Then find the related call site in `objdump-d.txt` (usually through a `@plt` symbol).
