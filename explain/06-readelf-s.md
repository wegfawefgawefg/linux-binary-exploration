# `readelf-s.txt`: Symbols (Names For Addresses)

Source: `learning/outputs/readelf-s.txt` (generated by `readelf -s build/basic`).

This file contains two symbol tables:

- `.dynsym`: symbols needed for dynamic linking (usually smaller).
- `.symtab`: the full symbol table (usually larger, missing in stripped binaries).

Key columns:

- `Value`: address (virtual address for the section the symbol lives in).
- `Type`: `FUNC`, `OBJECT`, etc.
- `Bind`: `LOCAL`, `GLOBAL`, `WEAK`.
- `Ndx`: which section index the symbol is in, or `UND` for undefined (resolved from a shared library).

Things to find in this repo:

- Your functions: `add`, `main` (usually `GLOBAL FUNC` in `.symtab`).
- Your global: `POTATO` (in this repo it is `LOCAL OBJECT` because it is `static` in `src/basic.c`).
- Imported functions: `printf@GLIBC_...` (these show as `UND` because the code is in libc, not in your binary).

Connection to disassembly:

- The address of `add` here matches the label in `objdump-d.txt` (example: `<add>`).
- A RIP-relative load in `objdump` that references `<POTATO>` is exactly your code touching that global.
