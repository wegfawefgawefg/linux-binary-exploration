# `readelf-S.txt`: Sections (The Named Pieces)

Source: `learning/outputs/readelf-S.txt` (generated by `readelf -S build/basic`).

This shows the ELF *sections* in the file.

The sections you will usually care about first:

- `.text`: machine code (your compiled functions).
- `.rodata`: read-only constants (format strings, literal data).
- `.data`: initialized global/static variables.
- `.bss`: zero-initialized global/static variables (takes no space in the file; it's `NOBITS`).
- `.symtab` and `.strtab`: full symbol table and its string table (often removed when stripping).
- `.dynsym` and `.dynstr`: dynamic symbol table used by the loader.

Flags cheat-sheet:

- `A`: alloc (mapped into memory at runtime)
- `X`: executable
- `W`: writable

Useful mental model:

- Sections are a "linker view": named, fine-grained pieces.
- Segments (program headers) are a "loader view": chunks that get mapped with permissions.

Exercise:

- Find `.rodata` and note its file `Offset`.
- Then open `readelf-x-.rodata.txt` and you are looking at the bytes from that region, interpreted as a hex dump of that section.
