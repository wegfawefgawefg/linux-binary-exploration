# `readelf-r.txt`: Relocations (What Gets Patched)

Source: `learning/outputs/readelf-r.txt` (generated by `readelf -r build/basic`).

Relocations are "fixups" applied by the linker/loader.

You will typically see:

- `.rela.dyn`: relocations for data and various dynamic entries.
- `.rela.plt`: relocations for PLT entries (external function calls).

In a tiny program that calls `printf`, it is normal to see a `JUMP_SLOT` relocation for `printf`.

How to connect this to disassembly:

- In `objdump-d.txt`, calls to external functions go through `something@plt`.
- The PLT entry ultimately references the GOT slot, which gets patched using the relocation info here.
